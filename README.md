## Frequently Asked Questions
### How do I use this thing?
Download the mod from the releases section, install Minecraft Fabric for 26.1.2 and drag the jar file in your mods folder.
Look at your keybind settings. By default `V` opens the app launcher, `G` enables keyboard capture allowing you to type in
the windows, `B` opens the window manager screen.

### How can I press Escape in the windows?
Instead of using `G` to capture the keyboard, use `ALT+Q` instead. The only way to turn it off is to press `ALT-Q` again,
so the `ESC` key is forwarded to the application.

### How to do the relative mouse movement thing for 3D games?
Move your mouse over the window, then activate the hard keyboard capture mode. (`ALT-Q`)
Exiting the hard keyboard capture mode releases the mouse.

### Will there be multiplayer support?
Multiplayer support would require video streaming, a bunch of networking code and a rewrite of input handling,
so it's not really planned right now.

### But can I use it on a server though?
You can, but because it's a client-side mod, other players won't see your windows or be able to interact with them.
Also you will not receive the windows as items. To spawn a window in the world, go into the wm screen (default bind `B`)
and then press and hold the "Grab" button.

### Does this work in VR?
Depending on your VR mod, you can probably get the windows to display fine but you probably won't be able to interact with
the windows using your controller. Soooo, kinda.

### Does this work with shaders?
The windows are rendered into the world by themselves (not like blocks or entities) so a lot of shaders will break the functionality.

## Common issues
### Crash with `GLFW error: EGL: Failed to clear current context`
Try setting the environment variable `__GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS=0` in your launcher.

### Weird graphical issues
Some users reported success by setting the `Improved Transparency` option in the game settings to enabled.

## Building and Running
You need a Rust development environment and a Java 25 SDK.
```sh
./build.sh #all arguments are passed to cargo build
```

The final jar file will be in `build/libs`, or run `./gradlew runClient`
for a development environment
